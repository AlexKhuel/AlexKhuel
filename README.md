# Hi there 👋

I'm **Joshua Dowd**, a Computer Science freshman focused on building and shipping real systems. I emphasize end-to-end ownership, performance-conscious design, and practical trade-offs over academic abstractions.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

**C++ Chess Engine** — A performance-oriented chess engine built from scratch using bitboards for efficient board representation. Implements full chess rules (castling, en passant, FEN parsing) with state save/restore to enable future search algorithms. Designed with extensibility in mind for evaluation, move generation, and minimax/alpha-beta search.

## 🛠️ Core Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, Java, C++  
**Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Data & AI:** SQL, Firebase, vector embeddings (SBERT / cosine similarity)

## 🚀 Notable Projects

### DevMapped — AI Career Roadmap Platform (Being Refactored)
AI-powered platform that analyzes 5,000+ job postings using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to generate structured learning sprints. Built end-to-end with React, Express, and SQL/Firebase, including API orchestration and deployment. Iterated from MVP to rebuilt architecture under real performance and scaling constraints.

### C++ Chess Engine (In Progress)
Custom chess engine leveraging modern C++ and bitwise operations for fast move execution and board mirroring. Clean separation between piece arrays (human-readable) and bitboards (engine-efficient), with architecture designed for layering on evaluation and search algorithms.

## 💡 What My Repos Emphasize

- Performance-conscious design decisions
- Willingness to refactor and rebuild when architecture demands it

## 🌱 Developer Identity

Builder-first, execution-driven engineer with strong interest in systems, engines, and real-world software — not just demos.
