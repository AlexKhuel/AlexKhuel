# Hi there 👋

I'm **Joshua Dowd**, a Computer Science freshman focused on building and shipping real systems. I emphasize end-to-end ownership, performance-conscious design, and practical trade-offs over academic abstractions.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

**C++ Chess Engine** — A performance-oriented chess engine built from scratch using bitboards for efficient board representation. Implements full chess rules (castling, en passant, FEN parsing) with state save/restore to enable future search algorithms. Designed with extensibility in mind for evaluation, move generation, and minimax/alpha-beta search.

## 🛠️ Core Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, Java, C++  
**Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Data & AI:** SQL, Firebase, vector embeddings (SBERT / cosine similarity)

## 🚀 Notable Projects

###DevMapped — AI Career Roadmap Platform (Refactoring)

*AI-powered platform that analyzes 5,000+ job postings using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to generate personalized learning sprints
*Built with React, Express, and SQL; migrated from Firebase for performance at scale
*Uses Gemini AI and Xenova embeddings to match user skills against market demands and create actionable 3-5 week learning paths
*Delivered MVP in 40 hours, then refactored architecture based on real performance constraints
*Deployed on Render, currently helping students build targeted skill foundations for competitive roles


###C++ Chess Engine (In Progress)

*Custom chess engine using modern C++ with bitboards for fast move generation and board state representation
(Clean dual architecture: bitboards for engine efficiency, piece arrays for human-readable state
*Implements legal move generation for all pieces including edge cases (castling, en passant, pins, checks)
*Modular design separating board representation, move generation, and evaluation for easy algorithm layering
*Designed for future UCI protocol integration and Lichess deployment
